# STA 523 :: Homework 2

## Introduction

Writing clean and elegant code is more that just following a specific style. It
involves a continuous work flow of rewriting, restructuring, and rethinking how
your code functions. Homework 2 will get you started in the journey of
developing code that smells good.

## Tasks

### Part I

Tasks 1 and 2 will give you some more background information and prepare you
to successfully complete Part II.

#### Task 1

- Read sections [13.1 - 13.4](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html) in Advanced R by
  Hadley Wickham.

- Watch [Code Smells and Feels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oyiPBjLAWY) by
  Jenny Bryan. Her slides and related materials are available on GitHub
  [here](https://github.com/jennybc/code-smells-and-feels).

#### Task 2

As a team, agree on a common coding style. Refresh yourself with the code style
resources provided in Homework 1.

### Part II

Read through Tasks 3 - 6 to get an idea of Part II's purpose. As a point of
reference, one working example for inspiration of an S3 class is given by the
"Roman" class. See  `?utils::as.roman()`.

#### Task 3

Create a new class for the S3 OOP system. For your class, include constructor,
validator, and helper functions as explained in section 13.3 of
<i>Advanced R</i>.

#### Task 4

Create three methods for your newly defined
class in Task 3. These methods should either
use existing generic functions such as `print()`, `summary()`, `plot()`, etc; or
you may create a new generic function. Function `sloop::is_S3_generic()` can
help you identify which `base` R functions are S3 generics.

#### Task 5

Demonstrate your class and methods with two examples for each method.

#### Task 6

Provide a brief write-up that explains your class and methods.

## Essential details

### Deadline and submission

**The deadline to submit Homework 2 is Wednesday, September 9 at 11:59pm EST.**
Only your final commit and code in the master branch will be graded.
To submit, push your work to your assigned team repository on GitHub before
the deadline.

### Help

- Post your questions in the #hw2 channel on Slack. Explain your error / problem
  in as much detail as possible or give a reproducible example that generates
  the same error. Make use of the code snippet option available in Slack. You
  may also send a direct message to myself or the TAs.

- Visit the instructor or TAs in Zoom office hours.

- The instructor and TAs will not answer any questions about this assignment
 	within six hours of the deadline.

### Academic integrity

This is a team assignment. You may communicate with other teams in the
course. As a reminder, any code you use directly or as inspiration must be 
cited.

To uphold the Duke Community Standard:

- I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
- I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
- I will act if the Standard is compromised.
